# Portfolio
This repo contains the followings:
## Projects
- I implemented music search using constellation following the strategy of Shazam, and image search using SIFT features. (Course Project) [code](https://github.com/Muhammad0Awais/Music-Shazam-and-Images-retrieval-SIFT/blob/main/Music(Shazam)%20and%20Images%20retrieval(SIFT).ipynb)
- The project involved putting into practice an algorithm to use TF/IDF to index the documents and retrieve the documents that matched a query. (Course Project) [code](https://github.com/Muhammad0Awais/Search-Engine-based-document-processing-pipeline)
- This hackathon project addressed the problem of content filtering by employing machine learning for malicious content detection, OpenCV for blurring content, and speech recognition to detect and beep malicious content. (Hackathon Project) [Link](https://github.com/Muhammad0Awais/sber_zvuk_hackathon)
- This hackathon project resulted in an ML pipeline to assess adverts on walls using YOLOV3 to aid decision-makers in formulating advertising strategies. (Hackathon Project) [Link](https://github.com/Muhammad0Awais/Yolo-based-Advertistment-Analysis)
- This project involved benchmarking and comparing image correction algorithms for a video streaming company in order to establish which image correction algorithms are best for maximizing streaming quality; super-resolution was the solution.
