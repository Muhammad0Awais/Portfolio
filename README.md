# Projects

## Some of my projects
- I implemented music search using constellation following the strategy of Shazam, and image search using SIFT features. (Course Project) [code](https://github.com/Muhammad0Awais/Music-Shazam-and-Images-retrieval-SIFT/blob/main/Music(Shazam)%20and%20Images%20retrieval(SIFT).ipynb)
- The project involved putting into practice an algorithm to use TF/IDF to index the documents and retrieve the documents that matched a query. (Course Project) [code](https://github.com/Muhammad0Awais/Search-Engine-based-document-processing-pipeline)
- This hackathon project addressed the problem of content filtering by employing machine learning for malicious content detection, OpenCV for blurring content, and speech recognition to detect and beep malicious content.

- This hackathon project resulted in an ML pipeline to assess adverts on walls using YOLOV3 to aid decision-makers in formulating advertising strategies. (Hackathon Project) [Link](https://github.com/Muhammad0Awais/Yolo-based-Advertistment-Analysis)
- This project involved benchmarking and comparing image correction algorithms for a video streaming company in order to establish which image correction algorithms are best for maximizing streaming quality; super-resolution was the solution.
